          Crying over college assignments, trying to hit the gym consistently,
          and trying to get familiar with <mark>dsa</mark>, and{" "}
          <mark>java (oops)</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m confident enough with my web dev skills right now (still a
          noob though). Trying to learn swift/swiftUI to build a macos menubar
          app while completely ignoring my end semester exams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from all this, I&apos;m also trying to write more content and
          craft beatiful animated ui components (will publish them soon at
          ui[dot]asrvd[dot]me).
