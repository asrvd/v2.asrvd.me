          I'm confident enough with my web dev skills right now (still a noob though), so I want to build a saas by the end of this year. I'm also particiapting in a lot of hackathons both online and in-person. Trust me when I say this, hackathons are the best way to learn new things and meet new people.

          Apart from all this, I'm also trying to consistently write journal entries - they are like your own personal time capsule which you can look back to and see how much you've grown as a person. I have started gaming a bit too much recently, so I'm trying to cut down on that - <em>sigh</em>.
